    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability within a dataset. They provide information about how data points are scattered or spread out from the central tendency (mean, median, or mode). Here's how these measures are used to describe the spread of a dataset, along with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range:\n",
    "\n",
    "The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "It provides a rough estimate of the spread of data.\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset of exam scores for two classes:\n",
    "Class A: [85, 92, 78, 96, 89]\n",
    "Class B: [70, 98, 75, 88, 82]\n",
    "Range for Class A = 96 - 78 = 18\n",
    "Range for Class B = 98 - 70 = 28\n",
    "In this example, Class B has a larger range, indicating greater variability in scores.\n",
    "Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance measures the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "It quantifies the spread of data points while giving more weight to larger deviations.\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset of daily temperatures (in degrees Celsius) for a city over a week:\n",
    "[22, 24, 21, 20, 23, 19, 25]\n",
    "Calculate the mean: (22 + 24 + 21 + 20 + 23 + 19 + 25) / 7 = 21.71 (rounded to two decimal places)\n",
    "Calculate squared differences from the mean for each day and average them:\n",
    "Variance ≈ (0.77^2 + 2.29^2 + 0.04^2 + 1.04^2 + 1.29^2 + 5.29^2 + 6.29^2) / 6 ≈ 9.11 (rounded to two decimal places)\n",
    "A higher variance indicates greater variability in daily temperatures.\n",
    "Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "It provides a more interpretable measure of data spread since it has the same units as the data.\n",
    "Example: Using the same temperature dataset, the variance is 9.11. To find the standard deviation, take the square root:\n",
    "Standard Deviation ≈ √9.11 ≈ 3.01 (rounded to two decimal places)\n",
    "The standard deviation represents the average deviation of daily temperatures from their mean. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability.\n",
    "In summary, these measures of dispersion help quantify the extent to which data points deviate from the central tendency, providing insights into the spread or variability within a dataset. Researchers and analysts use these measures to better understand the distribution and characteristics of data, assess data quality, and make informed decisions in various fields, including finance, science, and social sciences."
