    "Skewness in data is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of data points in a dataset. It indicates the degree and direction of departure from a perfectly symmetrical distribution, such as a normal distribution. Skewness is an important concept in statistics and data analysis because it helps us understand the shape of a data distribution.\n",

    "Key points about skewness in data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetrical Distribution: In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the data is evenly distributed on both sides of the central point (e.g., the mean, median, or mode), and the left and right tails of the distribution are mirror images of each other. In this case, skewness is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive Skew (Right Skew): A dataset is positively skewed when it has a long right tail. This means that the majority of data points are concentrated on the left side of the distribution, and there are relatively few extreme values on the right side. In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is typically greater than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative Skew (Left Skew): A dataset is negatively skewed when it has a long left tail. This means that the majority of data points are concentrated on the right side of the distribution, and there are relatively few extreme values on the left side. In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is typically less than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness Coefficient: Skewness is quantified using a skewness coefficient, often denoted as \"γ\" or \"Skew.\" It is a measure of the third standardized moment of the data distribution and is calculated using the formula:\n",

    "If Skew is greater than 0, the distribution is positively skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Skew is less than 0, the distribution is negatively skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Skew is close to 0, the distribution is approximately symmetrical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: Skewness provides insights into the shape and behavior of a dataset. Positive skewness suggests that the data is concentrated on the lower end, while negative skewness suggests concentration on the higher end. Skewness can affect the choice of statistical methods and can indicate the presence of outliers or non-normality in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding skewness is important in data analysis, as it influences decisions about data transformation, statistical tests, and modeling approaches. It helps analysts assess the appropriateness of assuming a normal distribution and guides them in selecting the most suitable descriptive and inferential statistics for a given dataset."
