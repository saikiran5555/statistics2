    "Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) and measures of dispersion (range, variance, and standard deviation) in a dataset. Their impact depends on the magnitude and direction of the outliers. Here's how outliers can affect these measures, along with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean:\n",
    "Outliers can have a substantial impact on the mean. Extreme values can pull the mean in the direction of the outliers.\n",
    "For positive outliers, the mean tends to be greater than the median.\n",
    "For negative outliers, the mean tends to be smaller than the median.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider the following dataset of exam scores (out of 100):\n",
    "[80, 85, 90, 92, 95, 98, 100, 25]\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the outlier (25), the mean is 91.14.\n",
    "With the outlier, the mean drops to 79.38, significantly lower due to the extreme value.\n",
    "Median:\n",
    "The median is less affected by outliers. It is resistant to the influence of extreme values because it is based on the middle value of the sorted dataset.\n",
    "The median may remain relatively stable even in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range:\n",
    "Outliers can significantly affect the range, as it is determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n",
    "If an outlier is much larger or smaller than the other data points, it can expand the range considerably.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider the following dataset of ages (in years):\n",
    "[20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 110]\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the outlier (110), the range is 20.\n",
    "With the outlier, the range increases to 90, due to the extreme value.\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation:\n",
    "Outliers can have a substantial impact on the variance and standard deviation because they involve the squared differences between data points and the mean.\n",
    "Large outliers can result in larger squared differences, which increase both the variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider the following dataset of incomes (in thousands of dollars):\n",
    "[40, 45, 50, 55, 200]\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the outlier (200), the variance is 260.\n",
    "With the outlier, the variance increases to 3150, due to the extreme value.\n",
    "The standard deviation shows a similar pattern.\n",
    "In summary, outliers can distort measures of central tendency, especially the mean, by pulling them in the direction of the outliers. They can also significantly affect measures of dispersion, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation, by increasing their values. It is essential to identify and handle outliers appropriately, depending on the context and goals of the analysis, to obtain more accurate and meaningful results."
