    "The mean, median, and mode are three different measures of central tendency used to describe the typical or central value in a dataset. They differ in how they calculate and represent central tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (Average):\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation: The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values.\n",
    "Use: The mean represents the arithmetic average of the data points. It provides a balanced measure of central tendency that considers all values equally.\n",
    "Sensitivity to Outliers: The mean is sensitive to extreme values or outliers. A single extreme value can significantly affect the mean.\n",
    "Median:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "Use: The median represents the middle value of the dataset. It is less affected by extreme values or outliers, making it a robust measure of central tendency.\n",
    "Sensitivity to Outliers: The median is not sensitive to outliers because it is based on the position of values rather than their magnitudes.\n",
    "Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have no mode (all values occur with equal frequency), one mode (unimodal), or multiple modes (multimodal).\n",
    "Use: The mode identifies the most common value(s) in the dataset. It is particularly useful for categorical or discrete data.\n",
    "Sensitivity to Outliers: The mode is not influenced by outliers because it is based on frequency counts.\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the arithmetic average and considers all values equally. It is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "The median is the middle value and is robust to outliers.\n",
    "The mode represents the most frequent value(s) and is useful for identifying common categories in categorical data.\n",
    "The choice of which measure to use depends on the characteristics of the data and the specific goals of the analysis. The mean is often used for symmetric, roughly normally distributed data, while the median is preferred when dealing with skewed data or datasets containing outliers. The mode is useful for identifying the most frequent categories in categorical data."
