    "To find the union (A ⋃ B) and intersection (A ∩ B) of two sets A and B, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given sets:\n",
    "A = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n",
    "B = {0, 2, 6, 8, 10}\n",

    "\n",
    "The intersection of two sets consists of elements that are common to both sets.\n",
    "In this case, the common elements between sets A and B are {2, 6} because they appear in both sets.\n",
    "So, A ∩ B = {2, 6}.\n",
    "(ii) A ⋃ B (Union):\n",
    "\n",
    "The union of two sets consists of all unique elements from both sets, without duplication.\n",
    "Combine the elements from sets A and B to form the union:\n",
    "A ⋃ B = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}\n",
    "Note that elements that are common to both sets (i.e., {2, 6}) are included only once in the union.\n",
    "So, the solutions are:\n",
    "(i) A ∩ B = {2, 6}\n",
    "(ii) A ⋃ B = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}"
